# Dhulkee Coursera

[Dhulkee Coursera][1] is a GUI based application meant to batch download
videos from [Coursera][2]. It is much more functional than wget specifically
in downloading videos from Coursera.org and easier to use than [coursera-dl][3].

With this application you don't have to worry about any technical issues.
You just open it, type in your login and password, load your list of
courses, select the ones you want to batch download and click download.
Simple as that.

Obviously there are several improvements I intend to make, such as an option
to download other resources, compact all the videos at the end of the download
and to work in background. In the future I intend to port this code the 
Android platform.
